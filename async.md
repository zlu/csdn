# Using Python Async/Await with LLMs

## Introduction
`async` and `await` are Python keywords used for asynchronous programming, which is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like making API calls, reading files, or querying databases. 

## What is async/await?
1. Asynchronous Execution:
    - Synchronous: Code runs one line at a time, waiting for each operation to complete.
    - Asynchronous: Code can pause execution of certain operations while waiting for I/O, allowing other code to run in the meantime.
2. Key Concepts:
    - `async def`: Defines an asynchronous function (coroutine).
    - `await`: Pauses the coroutine until the awaited operation completes.
    - `asyncio`: The Python library that provides the event loop for running async code.

### Example:

```python
import asyncio

# Regular function
def sync_example():
    print("Start")
    time.sleep(1)  # Blocks execution
    print("End")

# Asynchronous function
async def async_example():
    print("Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Doesn't block
    print("End")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_example())
```

### Why Use Async for LLMs?
1. Efficiency: While waiting for an LLM response, your program can handle other tasks.
2. Responsiveness: Your application remains responsive during API calls.
3. Performance: Better resource utilization, especially for multiple concurrent requests.

### LLM Provider Example

```python
# This is an async function
async def generate(self, prompt: str, **kwargs):
    # Some code runs
    response = await self.client.generate(prompt)  # Pauses here but doesn't block
    # More code runs after the response is received
    return response
```

### Key Points  
1. async Functions:
- Must be called with await
- Can only be called from other async functions
- Run on the event loop
2. await:
- Can only be used inside async functions
- Tells Python to pause execution until the awaited operation completes
- Other code can run while waiting
3. Running Async Code:
- Use asyncio.run(main()) to run the top-level async function
- All async functions must be awaited somewhere in the call chain

This pattern is particularly useful for the LLM provider because it allows the application to handle multiple LLM requests efficiently without blocking.
