# AI vs. Human Thinking: How Large Language Models Really Work

## Introduction

In the age of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal, driving advancements in technology and sparking debates about intelligence, creativity, and the future of human cognition. From chatbots to content creation, LLMs are reshaping industries and daily life. But how do these models function, and how do they compare to human thinking? While LLMs can produce remarkably human-like text, they lack the embodied experiences and dual-system cognition that define human intelligence. This blog post explores the mechanics of LLMs, contrasts them with human cognition—highlighting embodiment and System 1 vs. System 2 thinking—addresses ethical implications, and examines their real-world applications.

Artificial intelligence has progressed rapidly, with LLMs at the forefront. These models captivate us, prompting questions about work, creativity, and even machine consciousness. Yet, despite their ability to generate coherent text, LLMs operate fundamentally differently from the human mind. Understanding these distinctions is key as we integrate AI into society, balancing its potential with its limitations.

## How Large Language Models Work

LLMs are advanced AI systems built on neural networks, primarily using transformers—a breakthrough from the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. Unlike older recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process text in parallel, boosting efficiency. Their core feature, the attention mechanism, weighs the importance of words in a sentence, capturing context and long-range dependencies.

For instance, in "The cat, which was frightened, ran away," the attention mechanism links "cat" to "ran away," despite the intervening clause. This enables LLMs to produce coherent text. Training involves feeding them billions of words from diverse sources—books, articles, websites—and using unsupervised learning to predict the next word in a sequence, refining parameters via backpropagation. This process demands immense computational resources, often taking weeks or months.

Examples include OpenAI’s GPT-3 (175 billion parameters), Google’s BERT (optimized for context in search), and T5 (framing tasks as text-to-text). Post-training, fine-tuning on specific datasets enhances their utility in fields like medicine or law. However, LLMs falter in multi-step reasoning, causality, and prompt sensitivity, and their training is costly, raising accessibility concerns.

## Comparing AI and Human Thinking

LLMs excel at text generation, but their "thinking" differs starkly from human cognition. Humans leverage experiences, emotions, and contextual depth. When reading a story, we empathize, infer motives, and glean lessons—not just from words, but from a rich understanding of the world. LLMs, however, treat text as token sequences, predicting words based on statistical patterns, without emotions or a world model.

This gap shows in errors humans avoid. An LLM might write, "The cat barked at the mailman"—grammatically correct but nonsensical—because it relies on patterns, not comprehension. Humans have common sense (water is wet, fire is hot), while LLMs simulate it via data, occasionally erring, like suggesting gasoline to douse a fire.

### Embodiment in Human Cognition vs. Disembodiment in AI

Human thinking is shaped by our physical bodies and environments, a concept called *embodiment*. Our cognition ties to sensory and motor experiences, grounding our understanding in reality. For example, "warmth" links to both temperature and kindness, reflecting physical experiences. This embodied cognition enriches our knowledge and informs our language and thought.

In contrast, LLMs are *disembodied*. They lack physical form and sensory input, learning solely from text. Their "understanding" is linguistic, not experiential, which can lead to text that’s correct but lacks context or reality. For instance, an LLM might describe "running" without grasping the physical exertion involved, missing the embodied common sense humans possess. This disembodiment limits LLMs’ ability to draw on physical experiences, often resulting in outputs that lack nuance or contain subtle errors.

### System 1 and System 2 Thinking

Human cognition features two modes, as described by Daniel Kahneman in his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*: *System 1* (fast, intuitive, automatic) and *System 2* (slow, deliberate, analytical). System 1 drives quick judgments, like reacting to a loud noise, while System 2 tackles complex problems, like solving math equations.

LLMs mimic System 1, rapidly generating text from data patterns. They lack System 2’s capacity for reflection, critical evaluation, or multi-step reasoning. This shows when they make errors humans catch through logic or fail to adapt to new contexts, highlighting their reliance on associations over deep thought.

Humans generalize across domains and create novel ideas, while LLMs recombine patterns. Our multimodal learning—visual, auditory, tactile—contrasts with their text-only input, underscoring that LLMs mimic language, not thought.

## Ethical Considerations and Potential Risks

LLMs pose ethical challenges. Trained on internet data, they can reflect biases—e.g., linking leadership to men if that dominates the corpus—yielding discriminatory outputs. Their lack of embodiment and System 2 thinking worsens this, as they can’t reflect or draw on lived experiences to correct biases. Mitigating this demands rigorous data curation and oversight, a challenge at scale.

Their text-generation prowess risks misinformation—fake news, impersonation, phishing—eroding trust. Accountability is unclear: who’s responsible for harmful outputs? Over-reliance might also weaken critical thinking, as users depend on AI over deep engagement.

Training’s energy demands raise environmental concerns, and privacy risks emerge if sensitive data resurfaces in outputs. Job displacement threatens roles like customer service, necessitating support for workers.

## Real-World Applications of LLMs

LLMs transform industries: chatbots in customer service, content creation, code suggestions in programming. In healthcare, they draft patient reports, but their lack of embodiment limits understanding of physical symptoms. In finance, they analyze trends; in law, review contracts; in marketing, craft ads.

Creatively, they co-create poetry or games, though authorship debates persist. Researchers use them to summarize papers, but originality is questioned. In education, they personalize learning, yet their System 2 absence restricts deep feedback. Their versatility shines, but human oversight is vital.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

LLMs are powerful, excelling at pattern recognition and text generation, yet they can’t replace human thinking. Lacking embodiment, they don’t grasp the physical world; stuck in System 1-like mode, they miss analytical depth. They lack human creativity and judgment. As they integrate into society, we must address biases, misinformation, and more.

Future LLMs may handle images or audio, but ethical frameworks must evolve. Recognizing AI-human cognitive gaps ensures AI complements, not supplants, human intelligence. Digital literacy and human judgment remain critical, guiding AI to serve humanity responsibly.
