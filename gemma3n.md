In the context of Gemma 3N (or any multimodal transformer that processes images), the term “token” refers to a fixed-length vector representation of a part of the image — just like a word or subword is represented as a token in text models.

Image as Input: From Pixels to Tokens
	1.	Input Image Resizing:
	•	The model first resizes images to standard dimensions like 256×256, 512×512, or 768×768.
	•	This is done to match the image input to the expected input size of the model.
	2.	Image Patchification / Tokenization:
	•	The image is then divided into small patches (e.g., 16×16 or 32×32 pixel blocks).
	•	Each patch is flattened and linearly projected into a vector (a “token”).
For example, a 256×256 image divided into 16×16 patches results in (256/16)² = 256 patches → 256 tokens.
	3.	Result:
	•	Each of these patch embeddings is considered a token — similar to a word embedding in text.
	•	So, when you hear “encoded to 256 tokens,” it usually means the image has been split into 256 visual patches, each of which is turned into a token (vector) for input to the transformer.

Why Use Tokens for Images?

Transformers don’t directly work on raw pixel arrays. They need a sequence of embeddings. So for images:
	•	Token = vector representation of a patch
	•	These tokens are fed into the transformer just like word tokens in NLP tasks.



Summary

In this context:
	•	Token = one image patch turned into a vector embedding.
	•	The number 256 tokens means the image has been broken into 256 parts (patches), each of which is represented as a learnable vector.
	•	This is analogous to a sentence being broken into 256 words/subwords and processed by a language model.
